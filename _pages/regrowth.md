The project "How a Nation is Born: Reconstructing Four Centuries of Brazilian Economic Growth" (REGROWTH) started in 2022 with a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101031282){:target="_blank"} from the European Comission for two years at ICS, University of Lisbon. Currently the project continues at the Center for Research in Economics and Comparative Development at the Lusíada University of Lisbon.

The aim of the project is to build, for the fist time, prices, wages, real wages, GDP, and GDP per capita series for Brazil covering the period from first settlement in the 16th century to the year of the first income census in 1920. Initially, we will focus on the main cities of the colonial period, such as Salvador da Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco and Olinda, São Paulo, Porto Alegre and Rio Grande, and Ouro Preto and São João del Rey.

In this page, we will make available the data files (as soon as the papers are published) and other useful information built by the project.
