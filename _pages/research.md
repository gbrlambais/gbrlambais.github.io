<button class="collapsible" id="africaeducation">[Education for Control and Liberation in Africa and Among the Black Diaspora](https://gbrlambais.github.io/africa_education.pdf). *Comparative Education Review*, forthcoming. (with [Dozie Okoye](https://sites.google.com/site/dozieaokoye/home), Shourya Sen, and [Leonard Wantchekon](https://scholar.princeton.edu/lwantche)).</button>

<div class="content" id="africaeducationdata" markdown="1">
We review research on the history of education policy in colonial sub-Saharan Africa and among the African diaspora in the US and Brazil through a political economy lens. While the supply of education has been severely constricted in all of these cases, demand for education has been strong. Thus, even as authoritarian states have attempted to restrict educational supply as a means for social control, the strength of the demand---and the pedagogical, organizational, and political innovations that accompanied this demand---illustrate the power of education to empower marginalized communities.

#### Working papers

<button class="collapsible" id="subversion">[Judicial Subversion: The Effects of Political Power on Court Outcomes](https://gbrlambais.github.io/judicial_subversion.pdf). (with [Henrik Sigstad](https://hsigstad.github.io)). Submitted. [February 2022]</button>

<div class="content" id="subversiondata" markdown="1">
Are politicians in power treated more leniently in court? We show that Brazilian mayoral candidates charged with misconduct are 65 percent less likely to be convicted if they narrowly win the election. Politicians play no direct role in the judges’ careers, suggesting that formal independence does not completely insulate the judiciary from political influence. The effect is driven by districts with few judges and by judges with higher career instability.

<button class="collapsible" id="slave">[Slave resistance, cultural transmission, and Brazil’s long-run economic development](https://gbrlambais.github.io/resistance_longrun.pdf). [February 2020]</button>

<div class="content" id="slavedata" markdown="1">
 I show that ethnic territories connected to slave resistance, called quilombos, have a robust positive relationship with local economic development in Brazil. To understand how quilombos can affect economic activity in the long run, I propose a new mechanism where initial religious beliefs and African iron-working and other high-valued skills are perpetuated in the long run through cultural-religious intergenerational transmission. First, I divide the Brazilian territory in virtual municipality cells of approximately 11 x 11 kilometers, which makes possible an extensive use of ﬁxed eﬀects, and show that cells with more quilombos have more economic activity proxied by nightlights. Second, in order to analyze the mechanisms through which quilombos can aﬀect economic development and improve identiﬁcation I employ a randomization inference approach with alternative spatial configurations of counterfactual quilombos. I then show that proximity to quilombos is related to more high-skilled and metal-related occupations and a wide array of cultural-religious outcomes, such as higher cultural activities, community trust, and collective action.

<button class="collapsible" id="brnk">[Estimating a Behavioral New Keynesian Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07601). (with Joaquim Andrade and Pedro Cordeiro). [December 2019]
</button>

<div class="content" id="brnkdata" markdown="1">
 This paper analyzes identiﬁcation issues of a behavorial New Keynesian model and estimates it using likelihood-based and limited-information methods with identiﬁcation-robust conﬁdence sets. The model presents some of the same diﬃculties that exist in simple benchmark DSGE models, but the analytical solution is able to indicate in what conditions the cognitive discounting parameter (attention to the future) can be identiﬁed and the robust estimation methods is able to conﬁrm its importance for explaining the proposed behavioral model.
