Are politicians in power treated more leniently in court? We show that Brazilian mayoral candidates charged with misconduct are 65 percent less likely to be convicted if they narrowly win the election. Politicians play no direct role in the judges’ careers, suggesting that formal independence does not completely insulate the judiciary from political influence. The effect is driven by districts with few judges and by judges with higher career instability.

[[accepted version](https://gbrlambais.github.io/africa_education.pdf){:target="_blank"}] <button class="collapsible" id="africaeducation"></button>

<div class="content" id="africaeducationdata" markdown="1">
We review research on the history of education policy in colonial sub-Saharan Africa and among the African Diaspora in the United States and Brazil through a political economy lens. While the supply of education was severely constricted in all of these cases, demand for education remained strong. Thus, even as authoritarian states have attempted to restrict educational supply for social control, the strength of the demand—and the accompanying pedagogical, organizational, and political innovations—illustrates the power of education to empower marginalized communities. Through reviewing work in economics, history, and political science, we highlight the transformative effects of formal education in Black communities as well as the centrality of Black people in demanding access to higher education and innovating new political ideas and pedagogies that saw education as a force for liberation. Governments and citizens must continue to work to correct the inherited distortions in the supply of education in Black communities in Africa as well as in the diaspora.

#### Working papers

[African Slavery and the Reckoning of Brazil](https://gbrlambais.github.io/reckoning.pdf){:target="_blank"}. (with [Nuno Palma](https://sites.google.com/site/npgpalma){:target="_blank"}). [latest version: October 2025] [[CEPR](https://cepr.org/publications/dp18716){:target="_blank"}] [[Lewis Lab](https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=71436){:target="_blank"}] <button class="collapsible" id="as"></button>

<div class="content" id="asdata" markdown="1">
More enslaved Africans disembarked in Brazil than in any other country in the New World. Using new archival data, we build real wage and slave price series for Brazil covering 1574–1920. Wages initially matched those in Europe but fell as the slave trade expanded, only recovering when the trade ended and slave prices rose. We develop a directed technical change model with slave tasks to explain this finding. We also estimate a large, positive causal effect of slave trade prohibition on wages, consistent with our model. Post-prohibition, there was technological change towards free labor and concentration of slave labor in
high-disamenity occupations.

[Persuading judges or voters? The role of lawsuits in elections](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5183038){:target="_blank"}. (with [Moya Chin](https://sites.google.com/view/moyachin/){:target="_blank"} and [Henrik Sigstad](https://hsigstad.github.io){:target="_blank"}). Submitted. [latest version: March 2025] <button class="collapsible" id="elections"></button>

<div class="content" id="electionsdata" markdown="1">
What role do lawsuits play in elections? We document that 30 percent of Brazilian mayoral candidates are involved in election-related lawsuits and that they spend 11 percent of their campaign funds on lawyers. Candidates filing lawsuits rarely succeed in disqualifying opponents or annulling elections. Instead, the true motivation might be to influence voters: Most lawsuits are filed right before the election, and candidates feature the lawsuits in their media campaigns. Motivated by these findings, we estimate the causal effect of lawsuits on polling data and can rule out large effects on voters.

[Old But Gold: Historical Pathways and Path Dependence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4513384){:target="_blank"}. (with [Diogo Baerlocher](https://diogobaerlocher.github.io){:target="_blank"}, [Diego Firmino](http://www.padr.ufrpe.br/pt-br/authenticated/diego-firmino-costa-da-silva){:target="_blank"}, Eustáquio Reis, and [Henrique Veras](https://henriqueveras.github.io){:target="_blank"}). Submitted. [latest version: January 2025] <button class="collapsible" id="gold"></button>

<div class="content" id="golddata" markdown="1">
Following the discovery of gold in 1694 in Brazil, pathways were constructed to connect coastal settlements to mining regions in the unpopulated interior. While these pathways initially facilitated the creation of road towns, their influence faded by the late nineteenth century. With the mid-twentieth-century demographic and industrial transition, regions with higher historical road density experienced renewed population growth and greater migrant inflows. We argue that this resurgence reflects the role of road towns in fostering early urbanization and structural transformation. Using an extended Rosen-Roback-Glaeser framework, we estimate strong agglomeration spillovers, suggesting that Brazil’s spatial economy exhibits multiple steady states and historical path dependence.

[Estimating a Behavioral New Keynesian Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07601){:target="_blank"}. (with Joaquim Andrade and Pedro Cordeiro). [latest version: December 2019] <button class="collapsible" id="brnk"></button>

<div class="content" id="brnkdata" markdown="1">
This paper analyzes identiﬁcation issues of a behavorial New Keynesian model and estimates it using likelihood-based and limited-information methods with identiﬁcation-robust conﬁdence sets. The model presents some of the same diﬃculties that exist in simple benchmark DSGE models, but the analytical solution is able to indicate in what conditions the cognitive discounting parameter (attention to the future) can be identiﬁed and the robust estimation methods is able to conﬁrm its importance for explaining the proposed behavioral model.
