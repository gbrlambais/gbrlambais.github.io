#### [Judicial Subversion: The Effects of Political Power on Court Outcomes](https://gbrlambais.github.io/judicial_subversion.pdf). (with [Henrik Sigstad](https://hsigstad.github.io). [Latest version: May 2020]

Are politicians in power treated more leniently in court? We show that
candidates in Brazilian local elections charged with corruption are 43
percent less likely to be convicted if they narrowly win the
election. There are small differences in the lawyers representing
winners and losers, the effect is larger for members of powerful
parties, and judges convicting mayors are more likely to be promoted
by seniority than by merit. This favoritism could lead to an adverse
selection of politicians in elected offices: Politicians charged with
corruption are more likely to run for election and to become the next
mayor.

#### [Slave resistance, cultural transmission, and Brazil’s long-run economic development](https://gbrlambais.github.io/resistance_longrun.pdf). [Latest version: February 2020]

<div class="content" id="slavedata" markdown="1">
 I show that ethnic territories connected to slave resistance, called quilombos, have a robust positive relationship with local economic development in Brazil. To understand how quilombos can affect economic activity in the long run, I propose a new mechanism where initial religious beliefs and African iron-working and other high-valued skills are perpetuated in the long run through cultural-religious intergenerational transmission. First, I divide the Brazilian territory in virtual municipality cells of approximately 11 x 11 kilometers, which makes possible an extensive use of ﬁxed eﬀects, and show that cells with more quilombos have more economic activity proxied by nightlights. Second, in order to analyze the mechanisms through which quilombos can aﬀect economic development and improve identiﬁcation I employ a randomization inference approach with alternative spatial configurations of counterfactual quilombos. I then show that proximity to quilombos is related to more high-skilled and metal-related occupations and a wide array of cultural-religious outcomes, such as higher cultural activities, community trust, and collective action.

#### [Estimating a Behavioral New Keynesian Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07601). (with Joaquim Andrade and Pedro Cordeiro). [Latest version: December 2019]

<button class="collapsible" id="brnk">Abstract</button>

<div class="content" id="brnkdata" markdown="1">
 This paper analyzes identiﬁcation issues of a behavorial New Keynesian model and estimates it using likelihood-based and limited-information methods with identiﬁcation-robust conﬁdence sets. The model presents some of the same diﬃculties that exist in simple benchmark DSGE models, but the analytical solution is able to indicate in what conditions the cognitive discounting parameter (attention to the future) can be identiﬁed and the robust estimation methods is able to conﬁrm its importance for explaining the proposed behavioral model.
