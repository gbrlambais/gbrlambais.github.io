<div class="content" id="subversiondata" markdown="1">
Are politicians in power treated more leniently in court? We show that
Brazilian mayoral candidates charged with corruption are 65 percent less likely
to be convicted if they narrowly win the election. There are small differences
in the lawyers representing winners and losers, and judges convicting mayors
are more likely to be promoted by seniority than by merit. This favoritism
could lead to an adverse selection of politicians in elected offices: Politicians charged with corruption are more likely to run for election and to become the next mayor.

#### [Slave resistance, cultural transmission, and Brazil’s long-run economic development](https://gbrlambais.github.io/resistance_longrun.pdf). [Latest version: February 2020]

<button class="collapsible" id="slave">Abstract</button>

<div class="content" id="slavedata" markdown="1">
 I show that ethnic territories connected to slave resistance, called quilombos, have a robust positive relationship with local economic development in Brazil. To understand how quilombos can affect economic activity in the long run, I propose a new mechanism where initial religious beliefs and African iron-working and other high-valued skills are perpetuated in the long run through cultural-religious intergenerational transmission. First, I divide the Brazilian territory in virtual municipality cells of approximately 11 x 11 kilometers, which makes possible an extensive use of ﬁxed eﬀects, and show that cells with more quilombos have more economic activity proxied by nightlights. Second, in order to analyze the mechanisms through which quilombos can aﬀect economic development and improve identiﬁcation I employ a randomization inference approach with alternative spatial configurations of counterfactual quilombos. I then show that proximity to quilombos is related to more high-skilled and metal-related occupations and a wide array of cultural-religious outcomes, such as higher cultural activities, community trust, and collective action.

#### [Estimating a Behavioral New Keynesian Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07601). (with Joaquim Andrade and Pedro Cordeiro). [Latest version: December 2019]

<button class="collapsible" id="brnk">Abstract</button>

<div class="content" id="brnkdata" markdown="1">
 This paper analyzes identiﬁcation issues of a behavorial New Keynesian model and estimates it using likelihood-based and limited-information methods with identiﬁcation-robust conﬁdence sets. The model presents some of the same diﬃculties that exist in simple benchmark DSGE models, but the analytical solution is able to indicate in what conditions the cognitive discounting parameter (attention to the future) can be identiﬁed and the robust estimation methods is able to conﬁrm its importance for explaining the proposed behavioral model.

##### Work in progress

Geography, slavery, and income in Brazilian municipalities in the 1870s: A spatial equilibrium approach. (with Eustáquio Reis). [Version presented](http://www.ridge.uy/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lambais__guilherme_geography_slavery_and_income_in_brazilian_municipalities_in_the_1870s.pdf) at the RIDGE Workshop on Economic History, Montevideo, 2019.

<button class="collapsible" id="spatial">Abstract</button>

<div class="content" id="spatialdata" markdown="1">
This paper applies a spatial equilibrium approach to understanding Brazil’s initial heterogeneity of prices, working population, and income across municipalities in the late XIX century. Understanding the spatial equilibrium in the past is important to generate new insights on the development path taken subsequently into the XX century that would show a very unequal spatial development and a high degree of economic backwardness in an otherwise natural resource abundant country with a high land-labor ratio. Preliminary results show that the initial spatial equilibrium when shifted by exogenous geographic variables, such as terrain ruggedness, climate and soil suitability for commodities and staple foods generates perverse results for productivity and welfare that sometimes gets amplified by the factor share of slavery in a municipality.

Judicialization of Politics: Evidence from Brazilian local elections. (with Moya Chin and Henrik Sigstad).

<button class="collapsible" id="judpol">Abstract</button>

<div class="content" id="judpoldata" markdown="1">
Do electoral losers abuse lawsuits to delegitimize the winner? We show that
winners in close Brazilian mayoral races are 70% more likely than losers are to
face lawsuits regarding violations of electoral laws. This difference can be fully accounted for by frivolous lawsuits—cases ending in acquittal. The lawsuits are disproportionally filed by candidates with stronger financial backing, and seem to have deleterious effects on voter trust: Mayors facing frivolous lawsuits are reelected at a lower rate than mayors facing no lawsuits, and municipalities with frivolous lawsuits see a subsequent increase in voter abstention, blank votes, and votes for candidates with no prior political career.
