---

I am an economist at the Research Department of the Federal Labor Prosecution Office (MPT) in Brazil and at [SmartLab](http://smartlabbr.org/), a joint initiative with the International Labor Organization.

I have a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Bras√≠lia, with a one-year period as visiting scholar (with class credit) at Harvard University.

My research interests are related to political economy, economic history, and macroeconomics.
