I'm a postdoctoral fellow and a research affiliate at the University of Brasilia's Department of Economics. Also, I'm currently an advisor at the Research Department of the Federal Labor Prosecution Office (MPT) in Brazil and an economist at [SmartLab](http://smartlabbr.org/), a joint initiative of MPT and the International Labor Organization.

I have a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Brasilia, with a one-year period as visiting scholar (with class credit) at Harvard University.

My research interests are related to political economy, economic history, and macroeconomics.
