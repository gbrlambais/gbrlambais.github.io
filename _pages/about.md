I am an economist at [SmartLab](http://smartlabbr.org/) a initiative of the Federal Labor Prosecution Office (MPT) and the International Labor Organization in Brazil.

I have a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Bras√≠lia, with a period as visiting scholar (with credit) at Harvard University.
