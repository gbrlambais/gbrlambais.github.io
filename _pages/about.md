I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Lisbon's Institute of Social Sciences (ICS) developing the [REGROWTH](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101031282){:target="_blank"} project "How a Nation is Born: Reconstructing Four Centuries of Brazilian Economic Growth."

I'm interested in economic history, political economy, and economic development.

I have a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Brasilia, with a one-year period as visiting scholar (with class credit) at Harvard University. My dissertation was selected as one of the best in the department in the last four-year period.

Previous to ICS, I was an advisor to the chief prosecutor of the Research Department at the Federal Labor Prosecution Office (MPT) in Brazil and an economist at [SmartLab](https://smartlabbr.org/){:target="_blank"}, a joint initiative of the MPT with the International Labor Organization, and a research affiliate at the University of Brasilia's Department of Economics.
