Starting in the 2022 fall semester, I will be a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellow at the Instituto de Ciências Sociais--Universidade de Lisboa to develop the [REGROWTH](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101031282) project, "How a Nation is Born: Reconstructing Four Centuries of Brazilian Economic Growth."

I'm also a research affiliate at the University of Brasilia's Department of Economics and currently an advisor at the Research Department of the Federal Labor Prosecution Office (MPT) in Brazil and an economist at [SmartLab](http://smartlabbr.org/), a joint initiative of the MPT and the International Labor Organization.

I have a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Brasilia, with a one-year period as visiting scholar (with class credit) at Harvard University. My dissertion was selected as one of the best in the department in the last four year period.

My research interests are related to economic history, political economy, and macroeconomics.
